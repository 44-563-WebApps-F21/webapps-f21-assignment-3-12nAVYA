        <h1>victoria Falls</h1>
        <p>
            victoria Falls (Lozi: Mosi-oa-Tunya, "The Smoke That Thunders"; Tonga: Shungu Namutitima, "Boiling Water") 
            is a waterfall on the Zambezi River in southern Africa, which provides habitat for several unique species of plants 
            and animals. It is located on the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe and is one of the world's largest waterfalls, 
            with a width of 1,708 m (5,604 ft).David Livingstone, the Scottish missionary and explorer, is believed to have been 
            the first European to view the falls on 16 November 1855, from what is now known as <b>Livingstone Island</b>, one of 
            two land masses in the middle of the river, immediately upstream from the falls near the Zambian shore. 
            Livingstone named his sighting in honour of <b>Queen Victoria</b>, but the Sotho language name, Mosi-oa-Tunya—"The Smoke 
            That Thunders"—continues in common usage. The World Heritage List officially recognises both names.

        <h2>Directions from Maryville to Victoria Falls:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>First travelling to Kansas city from Maryville through car.</li>
            <li>From Kansas city take a flight to Zambia,Johannesburg.</li>
            <li>After arriving in Johannesburg, we’d then have to catch a connecting flight to the closest airports to Victoria Falls.
                <ol>
                    <li>When we made our visit in late May 2008, the country of Zimbabwe was undergoing some political turmoil, 
                        which made it too risky to fly to the Victoria Falls airport. That flight would have taken us under 2 hours.</li>
                    <li>Instead, we wound up flying from Johannesburg to Livingstone, Zambia. That flight took us under 2 hours. 
                        However, the distance between Livingstone and the actual waterfall itself was around 11km, which was a bit 
                        much for a walk. So we had to take a taxi there.</li>
                    <li>On the other hand, had we been able to fly right into the town of Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, then we conceivably 
                        could have been transported to the main part of town, then literally walk 2km or so to the actual waterfall itself.</li>
                    <li>A luxury dinner train crosses from Zambia to Zimbabwe over the Zambezi River and stops in the middle for a 
                        view of the Falls (though plans call for an additional departure in the other direction). For an aerial view, 
                        microlight flights are popular, and so is bungee jumping.</li>
                </ol>

<blockquote>Depth-first search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. 
    The algorithm starts at the root node (selecting some arbitrary node as the root node in the case of a graph) 
    and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
